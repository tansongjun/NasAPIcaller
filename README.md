# NasAPIcaller
Code for us to load open source models from NAS (suntec) into local GPU.

Ensure comfyui server is running before executing main.py

main.py will execute workflows for all jsons in the same folder as it. 

Do note that flux.2 dev is a very large model and may take a significiant amount of time to load.
