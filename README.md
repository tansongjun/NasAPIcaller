# NasAPIcaller
Code for us to load open source models from NAS (suntec) into local GPU.

Ensure comfyui server is running before executing main.py

main.py will execute workflows for all jsons in the same folder as it. 

To attach a reference image to the model, place the image in the same folder as main.py and rename the image to the respective model. 

Do note that flux.2 dev is a very large model and may take a significiant amount of time to load.
